#SNAKE 2022
https://helsinky91.github.io/snake-2022/

##Description:
Recreation of the snake game from the old Nokia 3310

##MVP:
The snake is supposed to eat the apples and grow a bit each apple it eats.

##Backlog:
I've used canvas to define the game board and also to draw the snake and the objects.
I've used then JavaScript to make the snake grow each time it eats an apple.

##Data structure:
I've created 3 classes: Apples, Snake and Game, all connected between each other,
with functions inide each of them.

##The game:
It has three screens:
Introduction
Game screen -- there is no winning screen
Game Over
